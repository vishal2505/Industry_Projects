We are also responsible for automation and observability to monitor and scale the applications as required.

## Roles and Responsibilities

•	Design, code, test, and deliver high-quality software.
•	Provision Infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.
•	Deploy Machine Learning/NLP models to production using an automated CI/CD pipeline.
•	Migrate data from On-prem servers to AWS S3.
•	Automate manual operational work for example - datacenter failover using rest api and Python.
•	Implement required telemetry and observability using Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, and Prometheus to monitor and measure the quality of service in real-time against the established SLO.
