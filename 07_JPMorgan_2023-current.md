## Applied AI/ML and Data Analytics Projects

As part of the central Data Analytics Platform, we are responsible for deploying multiple machine learning models (Model Serving) to AWS Cloud using infrastructure as Code. 
We are also responsible for automation and observability to monitor and scale the applications as required.

### Roles and Responsibilities

  1. Design, code, test, and deliver high-quality software.
  2. Provision Infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.
  3. Deploy Machine Learning/NLP models to production using an automated CI/CD pipeline.
  4. Migrate data from On-prem servers to AWS S3.
  5. Automate manual operational work for example - datacenter failover using rest api and Python.
  6. Implement required telemetry and observability using Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, and Prometheus to monitor and measure the quality of service in real-time against the established SLO.
